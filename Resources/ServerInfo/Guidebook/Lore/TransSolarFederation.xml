# Trans-Solarian Federation (TSF) Lore Summary



The [bold][color=cyan]Trans-Solarian Federation (TSF)[/bold][/color] is a dominant, galaxy-spanning superpower born from the ruins of
the [bold]United Nations of Earth[/bold] after a brutal period of expansionist warfare known as [bold]The Fracture[/bold]. with
Earth lost, the [bold][color=cyan]TSF[/bold][/color] re-established itself on [bold]Caligo Prime[/bold], becoming a hyper-capitalist, meritocratic regime
bolstered by cutting-edge [bold]Bluespace[/bold] technology and FTL travel.

A rigid class system defines daily life. Education, healthcare, housing, and job security are all influenced
by wealth and corporate ties. While the elite enjoy technological luxuries and mobility, the lower classes
are subjected to underfunded public systems, aggressive employment contracts, and expensive privatized services.

The [bold][color=cyan]TSF[/bold][/color] is lead primarily by two executive powers who separate their control of the
government between military and civil administration. The [bold][color=cyan]TSF[/bold][/color] Navy and Marines are directed
by [bold]Winter Solstice[/bold], an elusive and veiled figure who operates the military in the darkness, and
the formal civil government is headed by the President, who acts as a psuedo-dictator and gives
orders to [bold]Winter Solstice[/bold] directly, making the President the chief authority of the entire galactic
state. The [bold][color=cyan]TSF[/bold][/color] Navy and Marines tout some of the most advanced and optimized technology on
their spacecrafts, focusing on densely-equipped, high-power ships with terrifying effectiveness
and only the top-notch communications, weaponry, and transportation equipment in their
Marines and ground troops. This doctrine leaves their military remarkably effective but equally
expensive, and popular and corporate support for the military is primarily what keeps the
exorbitant budget demands of the [bold][color=cyan]TSF[/bold][/color] military afloat.

The Federation values productivity, personal ambition, and economic power, reinforcing a belief that
success comes only to the hardest workers—while failure is seen as moral weakness. Cultural expression
is dominated by corporate-controlled media, competitive gaming, and synthetic entertainment.
Propaganda heavily promotes loyalty, militarism, and consumerism, with military service and
entrepreneurship held as the highest callings.

Despite the Federation’s propaganda of unity, dissent simmers beneath the surface. Various fringe
groups, insurgents, and ideological rivals like the [bold][color=brown]USSP[/bold][/color] and [bold][color=#8B0000]Ashen Republic[/bold][/color] oppose the [bold][color=cyan]TSF's[/bold][/color] control,
though open rebellion is rare due to the Federation’s overwhelming power.

Celebrations such as the [bold]Grand Games[/bold], [bold]Day of Solus[/bold], and [bold]Autonomy Day[/bold] serve to rally patriotism and
maintain morale. Meanwhile, many citizens quietly endure a lifestyle built on survival, simulation, and
illusion—wrapped in the synthetic sheen of Federation glory.
